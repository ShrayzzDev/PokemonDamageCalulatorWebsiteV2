# Pokemon Damage Calulator Website

This is a website who's objetive is to calulate damages delt from one pokemon to another.
NOTE : This website is made to consume the API I made in ASP.NET, you can find it [here](https://github.com/ShrayzzDev/Pokemon-API)

# Technologies used

  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=php,js,html,css" />
</a>  
  
NOTE : Event though html and css are kinda obvious for a website, i am not exatly sure on what to use JS and PHP on. Might give one or another if I judge one of them useless.  

## Functionnalities

These are general and should not contain things like "model, DAL, DTO" or any too technical terms. (these are implied inside funtionnalities)

NOTE : This is obviously linked to the API advancement. If the site needs things the API is not doing at the moment, the website can't implment it either, and therefore I consider it does not make any sense to repeat it here.
