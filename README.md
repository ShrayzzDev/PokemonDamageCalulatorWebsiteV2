# Pokemon Damage Calulator Website

This is a website who's objetive is to calulate damages delt from one pokemon to another.
For the moment, let's say the website is functionnal. It works, yes, but it's incredibly ugly (currently not a single line of CSS, pure HTML and JS).
The objective is to have something at least readable, not a masterpiece in UX/UI, it is not really my cup of tea.
NOTE : This website is made to consume the API I made in ASP.NET, you can find it [here](https://github.com/ShrayzzDev/Pokemon-API)

## Functionnalities

These are general and should not contain things like "model, DAL, DTO" or any too technical terms. (these are implied inside funtionnalities)

NOTE : This is obviously linked to the API advancement. If the site needs things the API is not doing at the moment, the website can't implment it either, and therefore I consider it does not make any sense to repeat it here.
